  <h3> Controls & Objective </h3>
  
  The objective of the game is to dodge incoming cars as you increase or decrease your speed. Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to increase/decrease or dodge the cars on the road. You have 3 lives which are decrimented each time you collide with a car and if the counter reaches "0", then your game is over.
  
  <h3> Technologies </h3>
  
  * Javascript 
  * Tone.js

  The theme song is an original song that I transcribed to work with the library, tone.js. Above, you can see the individual notes of the song that is on a constant loop. I provided a play and pause button for an added element of immersion into this arcade style racer.
