  <h1>Jigsaw Rhapsody</h1>

  <br/>

  <h2>Background & Overview</h2>
  <p> 
    Jigsaw Rhapsody is an interactive artwork puzzle game that plays a complete set of chords when the puzzle is complete. Each puzzle piece will hold a note that completes the chord for that particular puzzle. When a piece is placed on the board, the note will play. The user will have a choice to play the set of notes that they have placed at anytime and incorrect positions will have a note that does not fit. Particularly some sort of jarring distortion effect that signals that it is obvious something is wrong.
